# FluidControlSim
On the field of industrial automation, it's a very common task to write some kind of control loop. A good simulator where people can design a custom analog system is good for junior engineers to practice or learn and also for seniors to try new ideas. There are plenty good simulation toolboxes on the market but most of them are expensive or hard to connect with custom control code. During my PhD process, I needed a good, easy-to-use simulation toolkit to test my algorithms and compare them with other solutions. I created this project only for testing. It has a descriptive user interface, an easy-to-use TCP-based network interface based on JSON, so it's easy to write programs on any platform to control the model. The models created by FluidControlSim are similar to a real-life container system, but it's unable to simulate one. Please don't forget that the main goal of this project is to give you a proper platform to write and test your control algorithm but not your model.

This is a living project, but I rarely update it. (I work in my own git server.)
